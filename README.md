# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide is an introduction for core concepts of creating a web application. Each section contains notes for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I learned a lot about how to structure, style, and logic to a website. I also learned about the GitFlow process and how to properly manage a code repo.
